# Gatsby TypeScript Styled Components Contentful Starter

This repo serves as Massive's starter project when working with the above stack.

All that should be required is:

- `npm install` to download all the packages
- Add a `.env `file with the necessary environment variables: `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID` & `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN`

If you are having issues, please try the following:

- Delete the `.cache`, `public`, and `node_modules` folders
- Delete `package-lock.json`
- Run `npm install` again
- Run `npm start` to start up dev server

If the above does not work, contact Andrew!
